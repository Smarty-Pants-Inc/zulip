{% trans branding_name=branding_name %}Here are some tips for keeping your {{ branding_name }} conversations organized with topics.{% endtrans %}

{% trans branding_name=branding_name %}In {{ branding_name }}, channels determine who gets a message. Topics tell you what the message is about.{% endtrans %} {% trans branding_name=branding_name %}Using topics, you can read {{ branding_name }} one conversation at a time. You'll see each message in context, no matter how many different discussions are going on.{% endtrans %}

{{ _("To kick off a new conversation, just pick a channel and start a new topic. This way, the new conversation thread won't interrupt ongoing discussions. For a good topic name, think about finishing the sentence: “Hey, can we chat about…?”") }}

{% trans %}Don't stress about picking the perfect name for your topic. If anything is out of place, it's easy to move messages ({{ move_messages_link }}), rename topics ({{ rename_topics_link }}), or even move a topic to a different channel ({{ move_channels_link }}).{% endtrans %}
